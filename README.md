# Customer-Behaviour-Analysis-on-Retail-Store
## Introduction

#### To analyze the retail store dataset according to Customer Behaviour Analysis , Atfirst  I have cleaned the dataset and do exploratory data analysis(EDA) and get the insights from the dataset using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries. The objective here is to perform a deep analysis on columns we have to understand the customer behaviour such as order date by week/month, customer's type (which segment do they mainly belong to), which category of the product is the most popular choice, and also the customer's product preference if they are from different background (country/city/state) etc.

- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
- Total Orders of Superstore Over Time
- Total Orders Comparison Between 2014 and 2017 (Jan to Dec)
